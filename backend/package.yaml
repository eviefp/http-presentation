# This is where we declare the libraries we depend on. We'll always depend on
# 'base', which includes the Prelude (whether we use it by default or not).
# All packages here are in a so-called package set, which is tied with the
# resolver/lts version from 'stack.yaml'. You can search for packages on
# 'stackage.org' for the current lts. If they exist but are not there, you
# might have to use the 'extra-deps' field in 'stack.yaml'.
